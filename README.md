“SUPR Accept SDK” has become **“Wirecard ePOS SDK”**.
 
We are constantly striving to further optimize our solutions for you and your customers and therefore kindly asking you to use the new repositories for your SDK Integration.

[Wirecard ePOS Developer portal](https://wirecardmobileservices.github.io/Wirecard-ePOS-Developer/)
        
Please review the content of these new repositories and take note of the changes made to the method names, if you have already started to integrate the SUPR Accept SDK.
 
If you already received credentials, these will remain unchanged.
 
We apologize for any kind of inconvenience caused and we thank you for your understanding,
Your Wirecard ePOS SDK team
